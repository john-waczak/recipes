Blanch green beans in batches in salted water for 3 minutes. Drain + cool beans and trim ends. In a pan, add EVOO and mushrooms and cook until brown. Reduce heat and add 4 tbsp of butter together with sliced herbs (it may be easier to do this step in two batches depending on your pan). Once finished remove mushrooms to a separate bowl. In the same pan, add remaining 2 tbsp of butter. Once melted, add in 2 tbsp of AP flour and whisk until golden & nutty forming a roux. Slowly begin to add milk, whisking to remove any clumps. Do the same with the cream forming a bechemel. Remove from heat and stir in cheese + garlic + pepper.\nMix together beans and mushrooms into a \\(9 \\times 13\\) baking dish. Drape the bechemel sauce over the top of the casserole. Cover with a sheet of aluminum foil. Bake 25-30 minutes covered until bubbling. Remove the foil and bake again until top is browned. Add a layer of French’s onions to the top of the casserole and bake again for 3-5 minutes until the onions are slightly darkened and fragrant."
