# History 

In good Grandma Judy fashion, this recipe was discovered on the back of the package (see above image) and has been a family staple ever since!

# Ingredients 

Casserole: 

- $1$ pkg Simply Potatoes Shredded Hash Browns (green package)
- $1$ can cream of chicken soup
- $2$ cups shredded cheddar cheese
- $\frac{3}{4}$ cups sour cream
- $\frac{1}{4}$ chopped onion (I usually use more like half)
- $\frac{1}{4}$ cup butter/margerine

Topping:

- $1\frac{1}{2}$ cups cornflakes, crushed 
- $2$ tbsp butter melted

# Preparation

Heat oven to $350^\circ$F. Spray a $9\times 13$ baking dish with cooking spray. Mix casserole ingredients in a large mixing bowl and then spread into baking dish. In a separate bowl, mix together topping ingredients and then spread over top of casserole. Bake 30 minutes covered and then final 15 minutes uncovered or until top begins to brown.
