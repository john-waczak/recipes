# History 


# Ingredients 


- $1\frac{1}{2}$ cups powdered sugar
- $1$ cup softened butter
- $1$ egg (room temp)
- $2$ teaspoon vanilla extract
- $2$ teaspoon almond extract
- $2\frac{1}{2}$ cups all-purpose flour
- $1$ teaspoon baking soda
- $1$ teaspoon cream of tartar

# Preparation

Mix powdered sugar, butter, egg, vanilla, and almond extracts. Stir in remaining
ingredients. Cover and refrigerate for $24$ hours. It helps to portion the
dough into $\frac{1}{2}$-gallon bags and flatten to making rolling out the dough
easier.

Heat oven to $375$ ${}^\circ F$. Let dough come to room temp. before rolling out
to roughly $\frac{1}{8}$ inch. Use cookie cutters to cut into assorted shapes.
Place cookies on ungreased cookie sheet and bake 7-8 minutes until light-gold in
color. Remove from cookies from sheets and let cool on wire racks.
